# fleeting notes
this file is for fleeting notes.
the ai will not mess with these files.
you don't have to worry about clean specs or anything.
just dump stuff here as needed.

# use scratchpad
the scratchpad section below is meant as an area to compose messages to be pasted into the claude session.
this way you get the normal editing behaviour of markdown.
and you also don't have to worry about your message being lost after accidentally hitting arrow+up one time too often.

# write some specs
to get started with spec driven development,
see seed.md or run /eidos:help

# remove default notes
wait i didnt write these notes, i should remove them
